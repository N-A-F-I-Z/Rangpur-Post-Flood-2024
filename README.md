# Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and Waterbody Extraction â€“ Rangpur, Bangladesh #

## This project applies Google Earth Engine (GEE) to generate a Land Use Land Cover (LULC) map and extract water bodies for Rangpur District, Bangladesh. The workflow uses Sentinel-2 MSI Level-2A imagery and a Decision Tree (CART) classifier to classify LULC, and applies NDWI/MNDWI indices to extract surface water features. ##

## ðŸ”¹ Data Sources ##

- Sentinel-2 L2A MSI (10â€“30 m resolution, BOA reflectance)

- FAO GAUL 2015 â€“ Level 2 boundaries (for administrative district mask)

## ðŸ”¹ Workflow ##

- Study Area Selection

- Rangpur District is extracted from GAUL (ADM2 level) boundaries.

### Image Preprocessing ###

- Sentinel-2 imagery filtered for Octâ€“Nov 2024 with <10% cloud cover.

- Median composite created and clipped to Rangpur boundary.

- True Color (TC) and False Color (FC) composites prepared for visualization.

### Land Use Land Cover (LULC) Classification ###

- Training samples: waterbody, built-up, agriculture, vegetation, and furrow.

- Features used: Sentinel-2 bands (B2, B3, B4, B8).

- Classifier: CART (smileCart).

- Training (80%) and validation (20%) split applied.

- LULC map generated at 10 m resolution.

- Accuracy assessed using a confusion matrix and an overall accuracy score.

### Waterbody Extraction ###

- NDWI = (Green âˆ’ NIR) / (Green + NIR)

- MNDWI = (Green âˆ’ SWIR1) / (Green + SWIR1)

- Threshold-based extraction (NDWI > 0.03) applied to generate a water mask.

## ðŸ”¹ Outputs ##

- LULC Map of Rangpur (10 m)

- NDWI Raster

- Extracted Waterbody Layer

## ðŸ”¹ Key Applications ###

- Monitoring land cover changes

- Agricultural land management

- Surface water resource assessment

- Supporting local planning and environmental studies

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries ##

- Google Earth Engine (GEE)

- Sentinel-2 MSI dataset

- FAO GAUL boundaries
